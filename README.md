#Weight & Macro Tracker

##Introduction
My goal in creating this weight tracker was to create a place where I could easily store all of my data and access it from anywhere. Many of the nicer services are hidden behind paywalls so I have been in search of something that I could style to my own goals and needs. This project is the culmination of a series of different versions and includes some Chart.js functionality as well as a proprietary responsive BMI tracker based on CSS.

##What does it do?
The app can do as follows.
* Read and write weight Data to an array and update a Chart.js chart. (Chart currently only updates on reload)
* Read Write and Delete food entries.
* Create a file and Save it to the server.
* Record Carbs Protein and Fat and convert them to kCalories.
* Show your current BMI in a heat map.
* Responsive Design

##Technologies Used

##Things that I would like to improve
* Upload the chart after I update data.
* Change my Calorie target
* Change some of the styling on the form inputs (It looks a little off)
